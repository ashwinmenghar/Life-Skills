## Q1) What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

The Feynman Technique is about explaining something in easy words, finding what you don’t understand, and making it clearer.

## Q2) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

I find it helpful to switch between focus mode and diffuse mode when solving problems. In focus mode, I concentrate on one solution and go deep into it. In diffuse mode, my mind explores different ideas. This way, I can gather multiple ideas and then use focus mode to analyze the best ones. It helps me combine deep thinking and creativity to find better solutions.

## Q3) What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active thinking is when we deeply focus on one task or problem and work through it carefully. It’s about deep concentration. Passive thinking is when our mind is relaxed and not focused on just one thing. In this state, we can think about many ideas at once, which helps us be more creative and open to different solutions.

## Q4) According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

1. **Deconstruct the skill** – Break down the skill into smaller parts to understand exactly what you need to be able to do once you've mastered it.
2. **Learn enough to self-correct** – Gather 4-5 resources on the topic and learn enough to recognize and fix mistakes while you practice, but avoid thinking you need to finish all the resources before starting to practice.

3. **Remove practice distractions** – Eliminate distractions like television, social media, and the internet that can interrupt your focus while practicing.

4. **Practice for at least 20 hours** – Dedicate a solid amount of time to practice, aiming for at least 20 hours of focused effort to build skill and improve.
