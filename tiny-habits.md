- The idea to develop any new habit.
  - **Format**: After I existing behaviour, i will do new habit.

**Q2) How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**<br>

### How to Use B = MAP to Make New Habits Easy

The formula **B = MAP** helps us understand how to create habits. It stands for:  
**Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt**.

Here’s what each part means and how it works:

### 1. **Motivation (M)**

- Motivation is how much you want to do something.
- It changes all the time, so you can’t depend on it.
- Instead of trying to feel more motivated, **make the habit require less effort**, so you don’t need much motivation.

### 2. **Ability (A)**

- Ability is how easy it is to do the habit.
- If it’s too hard, you need more motivation to do it.
- **Make the habit super small and simple** so it’s easy to start.
  - Example: Do one push-up instead of a full workout, or take one mindful breath instead of meditating for 10 minutes.

### 3. **Prompt (P)**

- A prompt is something that reminds you to do the habit.
- There are three types of prompts:
  1. **External prompts**: Alarms or reminders (but they’re easy to ignore).
  2. **Internal prompts**: Thoughts or feelings (but they aren’t reliable).
  3. **Action prompts**: Doing one thing triggers the next habit (this works best).
     - Example: “After I pour my coffee, I will take my vitamins.”

**Q3) Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)**

- Celebrating after each successful completion of habit gives our brain motivation to do more difficult tasks.
- It creates a sense of fulfillment within ourselves.

**Q4) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

- I liked the story about **Quality vs Quantity**.
- It taught me that we should focus on doing things and learning from our mistakes, instead of waiting to be perfect before starting.
- The more we do something, the more we improve, even if we make mistakes along the way.
- Making mistakes is okay, but it's important to get back on track quickly and not stop. This way, we keep building the habit and don’t break the chain of progress.

**Q5) What is the book's perspective about Identity?**
- Identity is what we believe about ourselves.  
- Most people focus on going from outcomes to identity, but it’s better to go from identity to outcomes.  
- The strongest motivation happens when a habit becomes part of who we are.  
- If we only solve problems for outcomes and results, the solution is temporary.  
- To solve problems for the long term, we need to work at a deeper level—by changing our identity.

**6) Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**
- Make good habits easy and appealing:  
- **Make it obvious**: Create an environment where good habits are easy to notice and access.  
- **Make it attractive**: Use what we know about dopamine to make habits enjoyable, so it’s easier to stick to them.  
- **Reduce friction**: Remove obstacles that make it harder to follow good habits.  
- **Reward yourself**: Give small, immediate rewards to your brain. This provides a quick burst of dopamine and keeps you motivated.

**7) Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**
- Make the bad habits more difficult to do or follow.
- Make action look ugly or unattractive .
- Try to increase the friction between you and your bad habits.
- Reward should be unstatisfying and delayed

**8) Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**
- **Habit**: Reading books  
- **Steps to make it easier or more attractive**:  
  - I will start by reading books on topics I really enjoy, as this will give my brain a quick dopamine boost, making it more likely for me to continue.  
  - I will place the books in spots where I can see them easily, like on my desk or next to my bed, so the cue to read is obvious.

**Q9) One habit I would like to reduce or do less of:**  
- **Habit**: Using Instagram  
- **Steps to make it harder or less attractive**:  
  - I have moved the app off my home screen and hidden it so it takes longer to access.  
  - I have set a password on the app, making it harder and less tempting to open.  
  - I have turned off notifications, which increases the friction and reduces the urge to check the app.
