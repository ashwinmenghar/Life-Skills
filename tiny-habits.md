Q1) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The idea to develop any new habit
Format:- After I existing behaviour, i will do new habit.
Existing behaviour that we do everyday with same frequency and want to do new habit with same frequency then old habit becomes our trigger.
Focus on changing behaviour rather than on outcome.
Beak it into tiny habits and put into right spot then you don't have to do anything.
